## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

  * **Python 3.8+**
  * **Node.js v18.0+** and **npm**

### 1\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/financial-analyst-ai.git
cd financial-analyst-ai
```

### 2\. Backend Setup

First, set up and run the Flask server.

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Create and activate a virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Environment Variables

The backend requires API keys for Google Gemini and Tavily Search.

1.  Create a new file named `.env` inside the `backend` directory.
2.  Copy the contents of `backend/.env.example` (or the snippet below) into your new `.env` file.
3.  Obtain your API keys:
      * **Google Gemini:** Get your key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
      * **Tavily Search:** Get your key from the [Tavily AI dashboard](https://app.tavily.com/).
4.  Replace the placeholder values in the `.env` file with your actual keys.

***File: `backend/.env`***

```
# .env

# Get your key from Google AI Studio: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"

# Get your key from Tavily AI: https://app.tavily.com/
TAVILY_API_KEY="YOUR_TAVILY_API_KEY"
```

### 3\. Frontend Setup

In a **new terminal window**, set up and run the React client.

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory from the project root
cd frontend

# Install the required npm packages
npm install
```

### 4\. Run the Application

You need to have both the backend and frontend servers running simultaneously.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    In your first terminal (in the `backend` directory with the virtual environment activated):

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    The Flask server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Server:**
    In your second terminal (in the `frontend` directory):

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The Vite development server will start, typically on `http://localhost:5173`.

3.  **Access the Application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to the address provided by the Vite server (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`). You can now start chatting with the AI\!

## üìù API Endpoint

The application uses a single API endpoint to handle analysis requests.

  * **Endpoint:** `POST /api/analyze`
  * **Description:** Receives a user's query and profile, processes it with the LangChain agent, and returns a structured analysis.
  * **Request Body (JSON):**
    ```json

      "query": "What are the key takeaways from NVIDIA's latest earnings call?",
      "profile": "a venture capitalist focused on AI hardware"
    }
    ```
  * **Success Response (JSON):**
    ```json
